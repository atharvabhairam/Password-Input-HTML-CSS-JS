# Password Input with Show/Hide Toggle

This project demonstrates a simple password input field with a show/hide toggle functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The toggle allows users to switch between visible and hidden password text for better usability.

## Features

- **Password Input Field**: A styled input field for entering passwords.
- **Show/Hide Toggle**: An eye icon that toggles the visibility of the password text.
- **Responsive Design**: The form is centered on the page and works well on different screen sizes.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the form structure.
- **index.css**: The CSS file for styling the form and input field.
- **index.js**: The JavaScript file handling the show/hide toggle functionality.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The form contains an input field of type `password` and an eye icon (`<i>`) that serves as the toggle button.
2. **CSS Styling**: The form and input field are styled using CSS variables for consistent theming. The eye icon is positioned to the right of the input field.
3. **JavaScript Functionality**: The `passwordToggle` function in `index.js` toggles the input type between `password` and `text`, and changes the eye icon to reflect the current state.

## Usage

To use this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter a password in the input field and click the eye icon to toggle visibility.
